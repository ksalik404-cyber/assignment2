# FOR LOOP: it helps to seperate values inside the code similar to number line \n
#lets understand with an example
l=['khan', 100 , 2.2]
print(l)
# when i ran this code all khan 100 and 2.2 is in one line.with for loop we csnput these values in different lines
for i in l:
    print(i)
    #yes that is right with this syntax i was able to seprate them
    # i reprents each element
 '''
'''
x='apple'
for i in x:
    print(i)
#this is how for loop works in loop case    
'''
'''
for i in range(1,11):
print(i)
#we printed range in a single line in range but with for loop we can display the same range in different verticl lines
'''
'''
#for loop can also be used for repetition
#say
for i in range(1,11):
    print('a')
#this printed a 10 times vertically
'''
'''
#WHILE LOOP
#counter variablr
#'a'---->5 times
#SYNTAX
#while (text expresion):
       #statement / increment or decrement
#task is to print a 5 times using while loop
